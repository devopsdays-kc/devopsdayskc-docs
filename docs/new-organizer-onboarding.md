  * Access to Trello
  * Access to Google Drive
  * Access to Slack (devopsdays national)
  * Create/link devopskc.com + devopsdayskc.org email
  * Added to devopsdays KC email lists
  * Access to all secret slack channels
3. Organizer will be added to the [devopsdays KC Organizer list](https://devopsdays.org/kansas-city/contact) once they've provided:

  * Bio
  * Pic
  * Social links (if desired)
