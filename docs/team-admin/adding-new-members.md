# Adding new Organizers

When someone wants to become an Organizer, they either make that desire known to an existing Organizer, or via email to organizers@devopsdayskc.org. The addition of a new organizer requires a majority vote from existing organizers. If any existing organizer vetoes a proposed new organizer, the new organizer will not be invited to join. The preferred path to becoming an Organizer is as follows:

1. Former DevOpsDays KC organizer in good standing
2. Volunteer in a previous DevOpsDays KC in good standing
3. Active participant in organizing DevOps KC meetups

Email (via the organizers@devopsdayskc.org email group) is the preferred method for proposing and voting on new members.

Upon approval, the prospective organizer will need to agree, and adhere, to the **[Organizing Agreement](./organizer_agreement.md)** and <Link to="/category/operating-procedures/">**Operating Procedures**</Link>.

Inspiration for this process taken from [DevOpsDays Core Team Membership Policies](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-policies/blob/main/policies/team-membership.md#adding-new-core-team-members) and [DevOpsDays Chicago](https://docs.devopsdayschi.org/organizing-team-administration/adding-new-members).
