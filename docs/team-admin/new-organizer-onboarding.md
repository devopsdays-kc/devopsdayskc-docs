# New Organizer onboarding

The goal of this process is to make it easy to onboard new Organizers to the team. This will be an ongoing, continuously updating document as more steps become known.

1. The new Organizer reads and accepts the following via the necessary form:

  * **[DevOpsDays KC Organizer Agreement](./organizer_agreement.md)**
  * **[DevOpsDays KC Code of Conduct](https://devopsdays.org/kansas-city/conduct/)**
  * **[DevOpsDays KC Operating Procedures](/category/operating-procedures/)**
  * **[DevOpsDays Core Organizing Guide](https://www.devopsdays.org/organizing/)**

2. The **Onboarding form** is sent to the new Organizer to collect all necessary information

3. Once the Onboarding form is accepted:

  * Access will be granted to the following systems:
    * Access to Trello
    * Access to Google Drive
    * Access to Global devopsdays Slack and `kansas-city@devopsdays.org` email group
    * Create/link devopskc.com + devopsdayskc.org email
    * Added to DevOpsDays KC email lists
    * Access to all internal slack channels
  * Organizer will be added to the **[DevOpsDays KC Organizer list](https://devopsdays.org/kansas-city/contact)**
  * Organizer will be added to existing meetings

4. Send the new Organizer an email using [this template](#new-organizer-email-template)
