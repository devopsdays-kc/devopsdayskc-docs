  * **[devopsdays KC Code of Conduct](https://devopsdays.org/kansas-city/conduct/)**
2. The **Onboarding form** is sent to the new Organizer to collect all necessary information
3. Once the Onboarding form is accepted:
  - Access will be granted to the following systems:
    * Access to Trello
    * Access to Google Drive
    * Access to Global devopsdays Slack and `kansas-city@devopsdays.org` email group
    * Create/link devopskc.com + devopsdayskc.org email
