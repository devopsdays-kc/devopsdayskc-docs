# Organizer Operating Procedures

## Participation

As set forth in the Organizer Agreement, Organizers agree to actively and meaningfully participate in the planning and execution of an event. If an Active member or Advisor does not participate to their agreed upon level, per the [Organizer Agreement](./organizer_agreement.md), they will be removed for the next event. To be added again, they will need to meet the following criteria for the next event:

- Being an active, committed Meetup organizer, and/or
- Being an active day-of Volunteer in the event

**Example:** Organizer (Active member or Advisor) from 2024 did not actively and meaningfully participate in the event, but would like to be involved in 2025. They would need to either be an active, committed Meetup organizer in the leadup to the 2025 event, or participate in the 2025 event as an active, day-of Volunteer, and would then be able to be added as an Organizer for 2025, and follow the process for [adding new members](./adding-new-members.md)

## Proposals

Proposals are implemented with the following criteria:

* Proposals must start with **“PROPOSAL”**, and be posted in the `#*_orgzr_announce` organizer channel on the DevOps KC Slack.  The proposal should also mention `@channel` to ensure all members are exposed to the proposal
* Voting will be open for 48 hours unless:
  * The proposal immediately passes if there are 4 or more +1’s not including the proposer
  * The proposal immediately fails if there are 4 or more -1’s not including the proposer
  * The proposer removes the proposal before it passes or fails
* Voting on a proposal is discouraged if you don’t hold a strong opinion
* Agreement will be noted by heavy plus sign Slack reactions
* If 48 hours have passed without any -1’s and without 4 or more +1’s, then the proposal will pass
* Disagreements will be noted by heavy minus sign Slack reactions
* If a -1 is added, then a cooling off period is required
  * The time of dissent will be noted in the comments by the dissenter
    * If no comment is made, then the start time is the proposal creation time
    * If a comment is made, then the start time is the comment time
  * From the dissent start time, the dissenter will have 48 hours to convince others to add their dissent
  * All dissenting comments must be acknowledged and preferably addressed by the proposer
  * At the end of the 48 hours, the proposal will pass if there aren’t 4 -1’s

## Meetings

### Planning sessions

Here is a guide for meetings during planning seasons for DevOpsDays KC

* Meetings will be on a set schedule of:
  * First Tuesday Night of the Month 6PM to 8PM - IN PERSON - 2 hours
  * Second Monday Lunch of the month 12PM to 1PM (Google Meet) - 1 hour
  * Third Tuesday Night of the Month: usually the [DevOps KC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-kansas-city/) week 5:30PM to 8:00PM
    * This is not required attendance, but a great time to participate in, and help grow, the community
  * Last Wednesday Morning of the Month: 8AM to 9AM (Google Meet) - 1 hour
    * TOTAL: 4 hours of potential meeting time every month
* Organizer agrees to put things on the agenda ahead of the Hangout meetings
* Organizer agrees to make every effort to attend the meeting, but understands there are competing priorities and sometimes myself or others will not be able to make it
* Organizer agrees to log and update Trello issues before or immediately after the meetings, so the meetings are respectful of other’s time

### Meeting preparation

To ensure our organizer meetings are clear, concise, and fruitful, there are a few things to be done prior to each meeting to make sure we are prepared.

#### Organizer tasks

The person who is the meeting organizer will do the following:

1. Add a new section in the Rolling Agenda doc above the previous meeting, and add the basics (Updates from Squad leads, Upcoming decisions, etc.)
2. Make a copy of the slide deck for the meeting from the template, with the correct document title following instructions on the first page
3. Link to the slide deck in the newly created meeting section in the Rolling Agenda doc
4. Send to Organizers Slack channel letting everyone know that Squads can update their slide on the deck

#### Squad tasks

1. Each Squad lead is responsible for making sure they have updated their specific slide(s), usually with updates on previous meeting TODO’s and any new business

  - Each Squad member should also be able to add updates as they have them, but they at least need to be communicating those updates to the Squad lead


2. During the meeting, each Squad provides a quick update and discussion on their slides, adding notes where necessary
   
  - At least one Squad member should be present to provide an update and for discussion

3. After the meeting, TODO’s are added/updated on Trello by each Squad

## Slack

Here is a guide for Slack usage before, during, and after planning seasons for DevOpsDays KC

### Channels

The below mentioned channels are not specifically named this way, but this lists out the intent of the channels and how they should be used. Each Organizer will be added to the channels as part of their onboarding process.

* ***_organizers*** - the original channel, which should mostly stay on topic about the conference, but sometimes strays and can be too much to keep up on but is great for searching for things later, assuming the history has not been lost.
* ***_external_feed*** - updates from Trello, with Trello being used for anything important because Slack will delete messages that are older than 30 days.
* ***_orgzr_announce*** - proposals, announcements, and important discussions that need multiple peoples feedback to either vote or make a decision on. If something is going to cost a fair amount (more than $250) and or will have material impact on attendee experience it should be brought here and the **Proposals** process above should be followed.
* ***#devopsdayskc*** - the front stage for the event. Where the other channels are backstage and organizers-only, this channel is where we would post tweets, announcements, etc. and try to build excitement and get the community engaged around the event.
