For more information about how to use GitHub Projects, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).

:::

Everything that we need to do will be tracked in GitHub Projects. This will include tasks, issues, and other items that need to be done. When a task is created, it will be assigned to a Squad, and then the Squad will assign it to a person. The person will then move the task through the project board as they work on it, getting feedback from the Squad and/or the rest of the Organizing Team as needed.
