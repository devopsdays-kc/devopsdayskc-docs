### Planning sessions

Here is a guide for meetings during planning seasons for DevOpsDays KC

* Meetings will be on a set schedule of:
  * First Tuesday Night of the Month 6PM to 8PM - IN PERSON - 2 hours
  * Second Monday Lunch of the month 12PM to 1PM (Google Meet) - 1 hour
  * Third Tuesday Night of the Month: usually the [DevOps KC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-kansas-city/) week 5:30PM to 8:00PM
    * This is not required attendance, but a great time to participate in, and help grow, the community
  * Last Wednesday Morning of the Month: 8AM to 9AM (Google Meet) - 1 hour
    * TOTAL: 4 hours of potential meeting time every month
* Organizer agrees to put things on the agenda ahead of the Hangout meetings
* Organizer agrees to make every effort to attend the meeting, but understands there are competing priorities and sometimes myself or others will not be able to make it
* Organizer agrees to log and update issues on GitHub before or immediately after the meetings, so the meetings are respectful of other’s time

### Meeting preparation

To ensure our organizer meetings are clear, concise, and fruitful, there are a few things to be done prior to each meeting to make sure we are prepared.

#### Organizer tasks

The person who is the meeting organizer will do the following:

1. Add a new section in the Rolling Agenda doc above the previous meeting, and add the basics (Updates from Squad leads, Upcoming decisions, etc.)
2. Make a copy of the slide deck for the meeting from the template, with the correct document title following instructions on the first page
3. Link to the slide deck in the newly created meeting section in the Rolling Agenda doc
4. Send to Organizers Slack channel letting everyone know that Squads can update their slide on the deck

#### Squad tasks

1. Each Squad lead is responsible for making sure they have updated their specific slide(s), usually with updates on previous meeting TODO’s and any new business

  * Each Squad member should also be able to add updates as they have them, but they at least need to be communicating those updates to the Squad lead


2. During the meeting, each Squad provides a quick update and discussion on their slides, adding notes where necessary

  * At least one Squad member should be present to provide an update and for discussion

3. After the meeting, TODO’s are added/updated on GitHub by each Squad
