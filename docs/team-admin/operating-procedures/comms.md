## Slack

Here is a guide for Slack usage before, during, and after planning seasons for DevOpsDays KC

### Channels

The below mentioned channels are not specifically named this way, but this lists out the intent of the channels and how they should be used. Each Organizer will be added to the channels as part of their onboarding process.

* ***_organizers*** - the main channel for the current event, and includes currently active Organizers and Advisors. This channel should mostly stay on topic about the conference, but sometimes strays and can be too much to keep up on but is great for searching for things later, assuming the history has not been lost.
* ***_external_feed*** - updates from GitHub, with GitHub Discussions being used for anything important because Slack will delete messages that are older than 30 days.
* ***_orgzr_announce*** - proposals, announcements, and important discussions that need multiple peoples feedback to either vote or make a decision on. If something is going to cost a fair amount (more than $250) and or will have material impact on attendee experience it should be brought here and the **Proposals** process above should be followed.
* ***#devopsdayskc*** - the front stage for the event. Where the other channels are backstage and organizers-only, this channel is where we would post tweets, announcements, etc. and try to build excitement and get the community engaged around the event.
* ***_organizer_Alumni*** - the channel for all past Organizers (Alumni), and where they can stay engaged with each other and current Organizers to share their stories and experiences.
