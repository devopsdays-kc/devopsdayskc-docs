# Organizer Operating Procedures

### Proposals are implemented with the following criteria:

* Proposals must start with **“PROPOSAL”**, and be posted in the `#devops_orgzr_announce` organizer channel on the DevOps KC Slack.  The proposal should also mention `@channel` to ensure all members are exposed to the proposal
* Voting will be open for 48 hours unless:
  * The proposal immediately passes if there are 4 or more +1’s not including the proposer
  * The proposal immediately fails if there are 4 or more -1’s not including the proposer
  * The proposer removes the proposal before it passes or fails
* Voting on a proposal is discouraged if you don’t hold a strong opinion
* Agreement will be noted by heavy plus sign Slack reactions
* If 48 hours have passed without any -1’s and without 4 or more +1’s, then the proposal will pass
* Disagreements will be noted by heavy minus sign Slack reactions
* If a -1 is added, then a cooling off period is required
  * The time of dissent will be noted in the comments by the dissenter
    * If no comment is made, then the start time is the proposal creation time
    * If a comment is made, then the start time is the comment time
  * From the dissent start time, the dissenter will have 48 hours to convince others to add their dissent
  * All dissenting comments must be acknowledged and preferably addressed by the proposer
  * At the end of the 48 hours, the proposal will pass if there aren’t 4 -1’s
