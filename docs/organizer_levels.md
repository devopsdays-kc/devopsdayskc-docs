# Organizer Levels

This outlines the different levels that someone could be involved with devopsdays KC 2024.

## Active

An Active member would put in best effort to attend meetings (at least one per month) and check in on Slack regularly (at least once per week). An Active member has voting rights on proposals. Proposals should be made on things that cost over $XXX and materially impact attendee experience.

There are two ways an Active member is classified:

### Sub-Group Lead (Active member)

A sub-group lead should be responsible for all things related to that sub-group. They do not have to DO everything related to that sub-group, but they should be informed. 

### Specialist (Active member)

A specialist is an Active member that is only interested in one aspect of the conference and does not need to attend general meetings. They do however agree to keep the rest of the group up to date on their area of specialization.

## Advisor

An Advisor is an organizer that has organized previous years, however does not want to be involved in the day to day. They agree to share opinions when asked, but will not carry out the task necessary to put on the event. They do not have voting rights, but can opine on anything they choose.

## Day of Volunteer

Not involved in planning. Only involved in day of activities. Would not have to pay for a ticket to the conference and would get to attend part of the event that they are not working during.
