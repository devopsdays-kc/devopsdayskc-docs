TODO: Put down how communicating with speakers is handled for DevOpsDays KC.

## Cadence

The below is the general comms list to be sent to the Speakers:

- CFP Open Period
- CFP Close
- First Round of Review - shorten the full talk list
- Figure out the number of speaking slots
- Second Round of Review - Select the speakers to offer to
- Send [CFP system] acceptances
- Gather acceptances - may have to follow up multiple times (we don’t get their email address until they accept)
- Send full email communication
- Create Trello Ticket for each speaker
- Gather agreements
- Use waitlist to fill any holes from non-accept/non-agreement/drop out
- Send the “Not-accepted” emails
- Update the schedule, speakers pages, and abstract pages
- Send the two month out communication about travel


## Examples

### CFP acceptance

Generally this would be sent via the CFP system, but could be used as a template for mass email from Google. You will need to replace _speaker.name_, _talk.title_, _confirmation_link_, _event.name_.
